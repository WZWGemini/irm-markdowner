### Statement
The project is forked from Github repo named [online-markdown](https://github.com/barretlee/online-markdown) which created by @barretlee.

I have just customized the remarkable markdown converter according to my favorite [Atom Material UI Theme](https://github.com/atom-material/atom-material-ui) and [Atom Material Syntax](https://github.com/atom-material/atom-material-syntax) as well as other function that I used to use.
